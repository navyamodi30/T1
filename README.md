ðŸ“Š Visualizing Data for Better Insights ðŸ“Š
During my internship, I had the opportunity to create bar charts and histograms to explore data distributions. For instance, I visualized the distribution of variables such as age and gender within a population, which helped uncover critical insights.

Data visualization isn't just about creating charts; it's about telling stories and bringing clarity to complex datasets. This task deepened my understanding of how visualizations can bridge the gap between raw data and actionable insights.
